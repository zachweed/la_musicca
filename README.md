# la_musicca

This project is a WIP while I work on teaching myself c++. The goal is to replicate directories and mp3 files from one directory to a queue.
From there the files in the queue are tagged with MusicBrainz https://musicbrainz.org/. Originally I would handle this work within Python through `python-musicbrainz3`, though I have decided to handle this work in C++ directly, for latency-purposes.
